                The foods you eat have big effects on your health and quality of life. Although eating healthy can be
                fairly
                simple, the rise in popular “diets” and dieting trends has caused confusion.

            <h2>Why Should You Eat Healthy?</h2>
            <p>
                Research continues to link serious diseases to a poor diet. For example, eating healthy can drastically
                reduce your chances of developing heart disease and cancer, the world’s leading killers. A good diet can
                improve all aspects of life, from brain function to physical performance. In fact, food affects all your
                cells and organs.

            <h2>Eating Whole Foods is Important</h2>
            <p>
                You should aim to consume whole foods at least 80-90% of the time. The term “whole foods” generally
                describes natural, unprocessed foods containing only one ingredient. If the product looks like it was
                made
                in a factory, then it’s probably not a whole food. Whole foods tend to be nutrient-dense and have a
                lower
                energy density.
